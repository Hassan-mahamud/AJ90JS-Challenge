## Day 2 of my AJ90JS Challenge

Set up the development environment with a code editor.

### Code editors

- There are two main types of code editors: IDEs and lightweight editors. Many people use one tool of each type.

    1. IDE
    2. Lightweight editors

### IDE

The term IDE (Integrated Development Environment) refers to a powerful editor with many features that usually operates on a ‚Äúwhole project.‚Äù As the name suggests, it‚Äôs not just an editor, but a full-scale ‚Äúdevelopment environment.‚Äù

### Lightweight editors

Lightweight editors‚Äù are not as powerful as IDEs, but they‚Äôre fast, elegant and simple.

They are mainly used to open and edit a file instantly.

The main difference between a ‚Äúlightweight editor‚Äù and an ‚ÄúIDE‚Äù is that an IDE works on a project-level, so it loads much more data on start, analyzes the project structure if needed and so on. A lightweight editor is much faster if we need only one file.


- There are other great editors in our big world but i chose VS code **Visual Studio Code** 


### Write your first "Hello world" program

``` js
console.log('Hello world')
```
