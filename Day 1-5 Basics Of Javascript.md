## Day 1 of my AJ90JS Challenge

### basics of javascript

- ~~introduction of javascript~~
- ~~What is JavaScript?~~
- ~~How it works?~~
- ~~What can in-browser JavaScript do & what can't?~~
- ~~What makes JavaScript unique?~~
- ~~Also I learnt that we can you use both client side and server side~~


## Day 2 of my AJ90JS Challenge

Set up the development environment with a code editor.

### Code editors

- There are two main types of code editors: IDEs and lightweight editors. Many people use one tool of each type.

    1. IDE
    2. Lightweight editors

### IDE

The term IDE (Integrated Development Environment) refers to a powerful editor with many features that usually operates on a ‚Äúwhole project.‚Äù As the name suggests, it‚Äôs not just an editor, but a full-scale ‚Äúdevelopment environment.‚Äù

### Lightweight editors

Lightweight editors‚Äù are not as powerful as IDEs, but they‚Äôre fast, elegant and simple.

They are mainly used to open and edit a file instantly.

The main difference between a ‚Äúlightweight editor‚Äù and an ‚ÄúIDE‚Äù is that an IDE works on a project-level, so it loads much more data on start, analyzes the project structure if needed and so on. A lightweight editor is much faster if we need only one file.


- There are other great editors in our big world but i chose VS code **Visual Studio Code** 


### Write your first "Hello world" program

``` js
console.log('Hello world')
```



## Day 3 of my AJ90JS Challenge
### Developer console

- Developer tools allow us to see errors, run commands, examine variables, and much more.
- They can be opened with F12 for most browsers on Windows. Chrome for Mac needs Cmd+Opt+J, Safari: Cmd+Opt+C (need to enable first).


Multi-line input
> Usually, when we put a line of code into the console, and then press Enter, it executes.

> To insert multiple lines, press Shift+Enter. This way one can enter long fragments of JavaScript code.

## The ‚Äúscript‚Äù tag

- We can use a ` <script>` tag to add JavaScript code to a page


JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML document using the `<script>` tag.

``` html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>

<body>

  <p>Before the script...</p>

  <script>
    alert( 'Hello, world!' );
  </script>

  <p>...After the script.</p>

</body>

</html>
```

ou can run the example by clicking the ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button in the right-top corner of the box above.

The `<script>` tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag.

### Comments before and after scripts.

In really ancient books and guides, you may find comments inside `<script>` tags, like this:

```js
    <script type="text/javascript"><!--
    ...
    //--></script>
```

### External scripts

If we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a separate file.

Script files are attached to HTML with the `src` attribute:


```js
    <script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>
```




## Day 4 of my AJ90JS Challenge

### Code structure

The first thing we‚Äôll study is the building blocks of code.

### Statements

Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.

We‚Äôve already seen a statement,` alert('Hello, world!')`, which shows the message ‚ÄúHello, world!‚Äù.
For example, here we split ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù into two alerts:


```js
alert('Hello'); alert('World');
````
Usually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable:


```js
  alert('Hello');
  alert('World');
```


### Semicolons

A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a 

line break exists.

```js
  alert('Hello');
  alert('World');
```

**In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But ‚Äúin most cases‚Äù does not mean ‚Äúalways‚Äù!**

There are cases when a newline does not mean a semicolon. For example:



```js
  alert(3 +
  1
  + 2);
```

### Comments

**One-line comments start with two forward slash characters //.**

like this

```js
  // This comment occupies a line of its own
  alert('Hello');

  alert('World'); // This comment follows the       statement
```


__Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and a forward slash */__ 

like this


```js
  /* An example with two messages.
This is a multiline comment.
*/
alert('Hello');
alert('World');
```
